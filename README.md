# Brainwave-Time-Series-Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for studying the relationship between EEG brainwave activity and design preferences. The project applies time series analysis techniques to explore how various EEG frequencies (Delta, Theta, Beta, Gamma) and gender influence design preferences.

# Overview
 This analysis focuses on identifying significant patterns and relationships in the time series data, using both regression models and interaction analysis.

# Methods Used
- Time Series Analysis: Examining temporal patterns in EEG data.
- Regression Modeling: Assessing relationships between brainwave frequencies (Delta, Theta, Beta, Gamma) and stimuli.
- AIC Model Comparison: Identifying the best-fit model for predicting preferences.
- Visualization: Plotting EEG frequencies and their interactions with stimuli and participant gender.
